### 2. Install Homebrew:

    Once you have the Terminal open, you'll need to install Homebrew. This is a package manager for macOS that makes it easy to install software.
    Copy and paste the following command into the Terminal and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>:

```shell copy filename="sh"
 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

During the installation process, you might be asked to provide your user password. Type your password and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> (note: you won't see the characters as you type).

### 3. Verify Installation

    Once the installation is complete, you can verify that Homebrew is correctly installed.
    In the Terminal, type the following command and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>:

```shell copy filename="sh"
 brew --version
```

This will display the `Homebrew` version number if the installation was successful.

```diff sh filename="console"
$ brew --version
> Homebrew 4.1.18
```

This command will display the Homebrew version number if the installation was successful.

</Steps>

## Conclusion

Now that Homebrew is installed on your macOS, you can easily manage software installations using simple commands like:

- To install a package: `brew install <package_name>{:sh}`
- To install an application: `brew install --cask <application_name>{:sh}`

For instance, to install the popular text editor VSCode, you'd run:

```shell copy filename="sh"
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```

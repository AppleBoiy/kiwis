# Running C++ Programs

## A Hello World Program

Here is a simple C++ program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:

```cpp copy filename="hello.cpp"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

To compile and run this program, follow the steps below.

<Steps>
### Save the Program
Save the program to a file named `hello.cpp`.

### Compile the Program
To compile the program, you can use the following command:

```bash copy filename="sh"
g++ hello.cpp -o hello
```

This command will compile the `hello.cpp` file and generate an executable file named `hello`.

### Run the Executable
After compiling the program, you can run the executable by executing the following command:

```bash copy filename="sh"
./hello
```

This will print `Hello, World!` to the console.

## Compile multiple files

If you have multiple C++ files that you want to compile, you can use the following command:

            ### Compile with GCC
            To compile multiple C++ files with GCC, you can use the following command:

            ```bash copy filename="sh"
            g++ file1.cpp file2.cpp -o output
            ```

            This command will compile `file1.cpp` and `file2.cpp` and generate an executable file named `output`.

            ### Run the Executable
            After compiling the files, you can run the executable by executing the following command:

            ```bash copy filename="sh"
            ./output
            ```
        </Steps>

            ### Compile with Clang
            To compile multiple C++ files with Clang, you can use the following command:

            ```bash copy filename="sh"
            clang++ file1.cpp file2.cpp -o output
            ```

            or

            ```bash copy filename="sh"
            clang++ -std=c++11 file1.cpp file2.cpp -o output
            ```

            This command will compile `file1.cpp` and `file2.cpp` and generate an executable file named `output`.

            ### Run the Executable
            After compiling the files, you can run the executable by executing the following command:

            ```bash copy filename="sh"
            ./output
            ```

            ### clang vs clang++

            - `clang{:sh}` is the C compiler, while `clang++{:sh}` is the C++ compiler.

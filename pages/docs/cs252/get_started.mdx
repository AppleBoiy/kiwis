# Getting Started with C++

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    Not just like <a href="/docs/cs111">Python</a>, C++ files need to be compiled before they can be run. The compilation process translates the human-readable C++ code into machine-readable instructions that the computer can execute. The compiled code is then executed to produce the desired output.

## C++ Compiler

Since C++ is a compiled language, you need a C++ compiler to compile and run C++ programs. The default C++ compiler on macOS is Clang, which is included in the **Xcode Command Line Tools**. You can check if Clang is installed by typing `clang --version{:sh}` in Terminal.
There are many C++ compilers available for macOS. They have some differences; on the other hand, they also have some similarities.

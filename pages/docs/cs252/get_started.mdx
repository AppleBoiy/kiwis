    Not just like <a href="/docs/cs111">Python</a>, C++ is a compiled language. You need to compile your code before running it.

## C++ Compiler

There are many C++ compilers available for macOS. They have some differences; on the other hand, they also have some similarities.

### GCC and Clang

        <Steps>
            ### Install GCC
            To install GCC on macOS, you can use Homebrew. First, update Homebrew by running the following command in your terminal:

            ```bash copy filename="sh"
            brew update
            ```

            Then, install GCC by executing the following command:

            ```bash copy filename="sh"
            brew install gcc
            ```

            ### Verify Installation
            After the installation is complete, you can verify that GCC has been successfully installed by checking its version:

            ```bash copy filename="console"
            $ gcc --version
            > gcc version 11.2.0 (Homebrew GCC 11.2.0_3)
            ```
        </Steps>
    </Tab>

            ### Install Clang
            Clang is already included in Xcode Command Line Tools. You can install it by running the following command in your terminal:

            ```bash copy filename="sh"
            xcode-select --install
            ```

            ### Verify Installation
            After the installation is complete, you can verify that Clang has been successfully installed by checking its version:

            ```bash copy filename="console"
            $ clang --version
            > Apple clang version 13.0.0 (clang-1300.0.29.3)
            ```
        </Steps>
    </Tab>

        ## GCC vs Clang
        Both GCC and Clang are popular C++ compilers that are widely used by developers. Here are some key differences between the two:

        - **GCC** is the GNU Compiler Collection, which is a free and open-source compiler that supports multiple programming languages, including C, C++, and Fortran. It is known for its high performance and optimization capabilities.

        - **Clang** is a C, C++, and Objective-C compiler that is part of the LLVM project. It is known for its fast compilation speed and excellent error messages. Clang is the default compiler on macOS and Xcode.

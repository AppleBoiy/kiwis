    # Assembly Language

    <p>Assembly Language is a low-level programming language that is used to write programs that directly interact with the computer's hardware.</p>

## Variant of Assembly Language

Assembly languages vary by architecture, each with unique instructions and mnemonics. Common variants include:

- **ARM Assembly**: Used in mobile devices and embedded systems, known for its efficiency and RISC architecture.
- **x86 Assembly**: Found in Intel and AMD PCs, offering extensive backward compatibility and a mix of CISC and RISC features.
- **MIPS Assembly**: Employed in academic settings and specialized devices, noted for its simplicity and RISC design.
- **Z80 Assembly**: An older language used in early home computers and embedded systems.
- **6502 Assembly**: Popular in vintage computers like the Apple II and early gaming consoles.

## Our Focus: x86 Assembly


In this guide, we'll focus on x86 Assembly, and we will use the **MASM** (Microsoft Macro Assembler) syntax and run on **DOSBox**.

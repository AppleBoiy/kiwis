If you already install `Homebrew` on your macOS, Python is already installed while installing `Homebrew`. You can check it by typing `python3 --version{:sh}` in Terminal

```bash copy filename="sh"
python3 --version
```

### Running Python Code in the Terminal

Python is an interpreted language, which means you can run your Python code directly in the terminal without needing to compile it first. Hereâ€™s how you can get started.

#### Write Your First Python Program

Just type `python` or `python3` in the terminal and press `Enter` to open the Python interactive shell. In this shell, you can type Python commands directly and see the results immediately.

## Install Go

Go is an open-source programming language developed by Google. Follow the steps below to install Go on macOS:

<Steps>

### Step 1: Install Homebrew
    If you don't have Homebrew installed, follow the instructions provided on the [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh).
    
    <Card icon={<BrewIcon />} title="How to Install Homebrew on macOS" href="/docs/homebrew"></Card>
    <Callout >
    If you already have `Homebrew` installed on your macOS, you can skip this step.
    </Callout >

### Step 2: Install Go with Homebrew
    Once Homebrew is installed, run the following command to install the latest version of Go:
    
    ```shell filename="sh" copy
    brew install go
    ```
    
    <FAQBox title="Do you want to install a specific version of Go?">
    To install a specific version of Go using Homebrew, you can use the following steps:
    
    1. **Check Available Versions**:
        ```shell copy filename="sh"
        brew search go
        ```
        This command lists all the available versions of Go that can be installed via Homebrew.
    
    2. **Install a Specific Version**:
        Once you've identified the version you want to install, use the following command:
        ```shell
        brew install go@<version>
        ```
        Replace `<version>` with the specific version number (e.g., `1.16`, `1.17`, etc.).
    
    3. **Link the Installed Version**:
        By default, Homebrew will not link this version to the system `PATH` to avoid conflicts. To use the installed version, you need to link it manually:
        ```shell copy filename="sh"
        brew link --force --overwrite go@<version>
        ```
        This command ensures that the specified version of Go is set as the default version in your terminal.
    
    4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
        You might need to update your environment variables to ensure your shell recognizes the new version. Add the following lines to your shell configuration file (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.):
        ```shell copy filename="~/.zshrc"
        export PATH="/usr/local/opt/go@<version>/bin:$PATH"
        ```
        Again, replace `<version>` with the specific version number you installed.
    
    5. **Verify Installation**:
        To confirm that the installation was successful and that the correct version of Go is being used, run:
        ```shell copy filename="sh"
        go version
        ```
        This command should display the version of Go you just installed.
    
    6. **Switching Between Versions**:
        If you need to switch between different installed versions of Go, you can unlink the current version and link a different one:
        ```shell filename="sh"
        brew unlink go@<current-version>
        brew link --force --overwrite go@<new-version>
        ```
        Replace `<current-version>` and `<new-version>` with the appropriate version numbers.
    
    By following these steps, you can easily manage and switch between different versions of Go on your system.
    </FAQBox>
    
    
### Step 3: Verify the Installation
    After the installation is complete, verify that Go is installed correctly by running:
    
    ```shell copy filename="sh"
    go version
    ```
    You should see the Go version information.

    ```sh filename="console"
    $ go version
    > go version go1.21.3 darwin/arm64
    ```
</Steps>
    
## Additional Step: Setting up Go Environment

you can set `GOPATH` and `GOROOT` by adding the following lines to your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc`

```shell copy filename="~/.zshrc"
export GOPATH="$HOME/.go" # or any other directory you want
export GOROOT="$(brew --prefix golang)/libexec"
export PATH="$PATH:${GOPATH}/bin:${GOROOT}/bin"
```

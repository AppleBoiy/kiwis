# Makefiles, CMake, and Build Systems

### Makefiles
Makefiles are used by the `make` build automation tool to define a set of tasks to be executed. They are widely used in Unix-based systems for compiling and building software projects.

- **Creating a Makefile**: You can create a simple Makefile to compile a C++ project as follows:

```makefile copy filename="Makefile"
all: main

main: main.o
g++ -o main main.o

main.o: main.cpp
g++ -c main.cpp

clean:
rm -f main.o main
```

- **Using the Makefile**: Run the following command to compile your project:

```bash copy filename="sh"
make
```

### CMake
CMake is a cross-platform build system generator. It uses simple configuration files called `CMakeLists.txt` to generate build files for a variety of platforms and build systems.

- **Creating a CMakeLists.txt**: Hereâ€™s a basic `CMakeLists.txt` for a C++ project:

```cmake copy filename="CMakeLists.txt"
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)

# Set the project name
project(MyProject)

# Add an executable
add_executable(MyProject main.cpp)
```

- **Building with CMake**: To build your project with CMake, run the following commands:

```bash copy filename="sh"
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### Build Systems
Build systems automate the process of converting source code into executable programs. They manage dependencies, compile code, and link binaries.

- **Common Build Systems**:
- **Make**: A classic build automation tool that uses Makefiles.
- **CMake**: A more modern tool that generates build files for various systems.
- **Ninja**: A small build system with a focus on speed, often used with CMake to generate Ninja build files.
